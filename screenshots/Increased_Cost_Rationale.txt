As budgest is increased from $6,500 to a maximum of $20,000, I have decided to increase the capacity of Web , application and DB.Due to this , there will be better performance than before.

For application server , I have reduced the capacity:

(From)
Reduced - t3.large,8gb,2vcpu,upto 5gigabit network perf , Instance 2 to 20
(To)
Increased - m4.4xlarge,16vcpu,High network performance, Instance 2 to 22

For Web server , I have reduced the capacity:

(From)
Reduced - t3.large,8gb,2vcpu,upto 5gigabit network perf , Instance 2 to 20
(To)
Increased - t3.2xlarge,32gb,8vcpu,upto 5gigabit network perf , Instance 2 to 20

For DB, I have reduced the capacity slightly as:

(From)
Reduced - m1.large,2vcpu,7.5gb memory , Provisioned IOPS 2800
(To)
Increased -m2.4xlarge,8vcpu,68gb memory ,Provisioned IOPS 6000
